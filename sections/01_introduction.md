# Introduction {#sec:introduction}

Modern cloud environments solve many problems like the discovery of services and data transfer or communication between services in general. As the development of cloud-native applications (CNA) evolves, older applications move to the cloud as well.

However, a specific problem is not yet solved: "dynamic" trusted communication between services. For example, a service that is capable of handling OpenID Connect (OIDC) credentials wants to communicate with a service that only knows Basic Authentication. The source service must implement some conversion mechanism or know static credentials to communicate with the basic auth service. In general, this introduces changes to the software. In small applications which consist of one or two services, implementing this conversion may be a feasible option. However, if we look at an application that spans over a big landscape and a multitude of services, implementing every possible authentication mechanism and the according to conversions will be error-prone work and does not scale well^[According to the matrix problem: $X \text{ services} * Y \text{ authentication methods}$]. In practice, we encountered the given scenario at various points in time when older applications were migrated into a cloud environment and newer applications were built around it. In almost all cases, the modern software was changed to communicate with the legacy systems, not the other way around.

The goal of the project "Distributed Authentication Mesh" is to provide a solution for this exact problem. By introducing multiple elements, like a translator in conjunction with a proxy that is capable of modifying HTTP headers in-flight, the described problem can be solved. The proposed concept uses a common domain language to transfer the authenticated identity of a user between services of a microservice application. The proxy then intercepts the requests and instructs the translator to transform the common language into the valid authentication format of the destination.

For further reading, basic knowledge about "Docker" and microservices is required. Furthermore, the implementation of the proof of concept (POC) is based on "Kubernetes" to display the concepts of the solution in a practical manner. In terms of authentication and authorization, the POC uses OpenID Connect and Basic Authentication, which are both described in later sections.

The remainder of the report describes used technologies, terminology, and concepts. Furthermore, the state of the art gives an overview of the current situation and the present solutions in practice. With the description of the distributed authentication mesh, the report shows the proposed solution and the architecture. Then, some elements of the solution are tested with an implementation of a POC on the Kubernetes platform. After the description of the solution, the evaluation checks if the goals and non-goals of the solution are valid. The conclusion then gives an overview of the work and a summary of the project.
