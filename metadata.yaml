abstract: |
  As more and more applications move to the cloud, security is a
  big concern. Applications shield themselves against attacks with various
  authentication mechanisms like OpenID Connect (OIDC). However, legacy
  appications that are not refactored nor updated tend to not support modern
  security standards. To enable applications to communicate with legacy
  (or third-party) software, it is often required to introduce code changes
  to the modern apps. To eliminate the leakage of credentials (like access
  tokens) and to reduce the risk of bugs, this project targets the dynamic
  conversion of a user identity. This identity authenticates the user over
  the wire instead of the effective credentials. This project gives the
  conceptional idea and the architecture, as well as a platform specific
  example of such a solution. Furthermore, a proof of concept answers
  relevant questions for the realization of such a framework. The evaluation
  then validates the architecture against the goals and non-goals and
  checks the architecture. In the end, the conclusion provides information
  about the project, possible further work, and the goals of the next
  project-phase.
