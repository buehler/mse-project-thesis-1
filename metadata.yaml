abstract: |
  As more and more applications run in a containerized cloud environment, security is a
  general concern. Applications defend themselves against intrusion with various
  authentication mechanisms like OpenID Connect. However, legacy
  appications that are not refactored nor updated tend to not support modern
  security standards. To enable applications to communicate with legacy
  (or third-party) software, it is often required to introduce code changes
  to the modern apps. To eliminate the leakage of credentials (such as access
  tokens) and to reduce the risk of bugs, this project targets the dynamic
  conversion of a user identity. This identity authenticates the user over
  the wire instead of the effective credentials. This project gives the
  conceptional idea and the architecture, as well as a platform specific
  example of such a solution. A proof of concept answers
  relevant questions for the realization of such a framework. The evaluation
  then validates the architecture against the goals and non-goals.
  The conclusion provides information about the project, possible use cases,
  and the goals of the next project-phase.
