  abstract  = {Get more out of your legacy systems: more performance, functionality, reliability,
and manageabilityIs your code easy to change? Can you get nearly instantaneous feedback
when you do change it? Do you understand it? If the answer to any of these questions
is no, you have legacy code, and it is draining time and money away from your development
efforts.In this book, Michael Feathers offers start-to-finish strategies for working
more effectively with large, untested legacy code bases. This book draws on material
Michael created for his renowned Object Mentor seminars: techniques Michael has used
in mentoring to help hundreds of developers, technical managers, and testers bring
their legacy systems under control.The topics covered include Understanding the mechanics
of software change: adding features, fixing bugs, improving design, optimizing performance
Getting legacy code into a test harness Writing tests that protect you against introducing
new problems Techniques that can be used with any language or platform-with examples
in Java, C++, C, and C# Accurately identifying where code changes need to be made
Coping with legacy systems that aren't object-oriented Handling applications that
don't seem to have any structureThis book also includes a catalog of twenty-four dependency-breaking
techniques that help you work with program elements in isolation and make safer changes.Â©
